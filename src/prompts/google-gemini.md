## Gerar imagem de capa do podcast

```markdown
Create an image of a **futuristic robot** hosting a **podcast**, in a **cartoon style**. The robot should be **humanoid**, with sleek metallic features and glowing elements. The scene should include a **microphone, headphones, and a high-tech recording setup**. The background should suggest a **modern studio environment**, with subtle details like soundproofing panels and tech gadgets. The composition should be balanced, with the robot in the center and the podcast equipment surrounding it. The style should be **colorful** and **vibrant**, similar to modern animated series. The image should be **proportional**, as if it were an actual scene for a digital platform (1:1 aspect ratio).
